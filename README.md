# Pre-work - Tips

Tips is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: Chelsea Fischbach

Time spent: 4 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:
* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] Custom font (unclear if color changes count)
* [x] UI animations
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

[x] Added “keep to change” functionality to recalculate tip based on rounding the bill to the next full dollar amount. 
[x] As part of this, I provided effective tip calculation, which animates in only when “keep the change” is enabled.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

It looks like there have been some big changes to Swift in a short time. When I was trying to build in additional functionality, I had trouble finding good resources for different functions as they were restructured. I think most of my trouble was with unfamiliarity and not being a great video-based learner, I had an easier time once I was just using trial and error. That said, I did run into issue with an object getting added incorrectly and it took a while to debug.
